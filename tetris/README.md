# TETRIS

This is a tetris game coded for a Techtonica assignment. This readme contains the current project plans and phases.

## Phase 1: Shape Generation and Spontaneous Movement

Phase one will be a basic grid which will spontaneously generate shapes that drop down until they hit the bottom of the grid.

## Phase 2: Basic User Manipulation

Phase two will allow the user to both transform and rotate the generated shapes.

## Phase 3: Row Clearance

Phase three will remove any occupation from spaces in which the whole row is occupied and allow the occupied shapes above to drop down into the empty space.

## Phase 4: Extra Features

Phase four will be further broken up into smaller features attributed to the original game but not necessary to its base functionality.

Features:

- Game gets faster the longer you play
- User is able to put tetris piece in holding cell
- User is able to increase the speed of the piece falling by using the down arrow
- Score is calculated based on how many rows are cleared
- User is able to enter and save their high score

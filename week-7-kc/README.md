Please note that the form is not working! Your first ticket as the intern in the new software company Techtonica.io is helping the frontend team and make the form work!
Things to do:
Make the form work!
At the bare minimum, your form should console.log all the values for a new refound in the parent component!
Extra bonus: Make a component for the success message works with the values from the user and, show the user values in a success message to the user (just as text - hint: you will pass the message as props to a component)
